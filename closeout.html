            From the moment you walked into my life,  
            everything became warmer, softer, and more beautiful.

        <p>
            Every smile of yours is a memory I keep close to my heart,  
            every moment with you is a blessing I never take for granted.
        </p>

        <p>
            On your birthday, I just want you to know  
            that you are loved more than words can explain.
